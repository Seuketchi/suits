description: Reverse engineer native, managed, Electron/JavaScript, packaged, firmware, and browser targets with REA, and build agent environments (AgentEnv bundles) of web applications from a live instance or a capture. Use shipped-artifact or requested runtime evidence to explain features, compare versions, decompile code, or guide a reconstruction. Skip REA for ordinary source-repository architecture analysis.

# REA

Use REA when a claim depends on a shipped binary or package, decompilation,
requested runtime evidence, or comparison with
behavior not established by available source. For ordinary analysis of a
complete source repository, use normal repository tools and do not run REA
readiness or provider commands.

## Rights check

Run this only on an artifact the owner owns, has rights to, or named in the request. Otherwise ask first.

## Connect only when needed

Installing this skill supplies instructions; it does not register the REA MCP
server, install analysis engines, or add tools to an already-running agent.
The exception is a Claude Code or Codex plugin install: the plugin bundles
this skill and registers its own `rea` server, outside the state that
`rea setup` and `rea doctor` manage.

If REA tools are available and their registration is not known to be stale,
proceed directly to the target. Do not run diagnostics or setup before every
investigation. Use the connected server's actual tool list and input schemas;
a skill installed from repository main may describe capabilities absent from
an older npm release. Keep complete inline Evidence when that server does not
advertise retained references.

Setup, registration repair and the CLI fallback are in [setup and CLI](references/setup-and-cli.md). Read that file only when tools are missing, a call is blocked, a provider is unavailable, or a registration needs repair. For an observed connection, command, approval or provider blocker, read [connection and recovery](references/connection-and-recovery.md).

## Route the target first

Choose the first tool from the target the user supplied. Use `open_binary` for
active-target native or archive workflows; target-free tools take their own
explicit path or endpoint and do not need it.

- Mobile app and package artifacts (APK, Apple app bundles and resources, archives and packages): read [mobile routes](references/route-mobile.md).
- Web and JavaScript (ASAR, Electron, Bun, live pages and their traffic, browser scenarios, AgentEnv bundles, WebAssembly): read [web routes](references/route-web.md).
- Binaries (native, managed, Go, Rust, PE, ELF and Mach-O files, native providers): read [binary routes](references/route-binary.md).
- Firmware and embedded images (firmware, ESP32-family images, kernel modules): read [firmware routes](references/route-firmware.md).
- Packet and signal captures (packet fields, PCAP, logic and signal traces): read [protocol routes](references/route-protocol.md).
- Other formats (EVM bytecode, model files, IL2CPP, crash reports, `.pyc`, BEAM, SQLite, crash cores): read [other format routes](references/route-other-formats.md).

If the user says only "my app" without a name, path, or target already selected
for this task, ask which app before searching for artifacts. Paths in unrelated
saved reports and nearby test fixtures do not select the user's target. Resolve
an actual human-readable app name to one clear installed artifact when possible;
ask when matches are ambiguous. Never choose an example app on the user's behalf.

In a target-free session, use `open_binary` to bind any archive/package or
native target whose analysis tool operates on the active target. Do not call an
unadvertised tool; inspect `binary_session` with `{}` and its
`result.tool_availability` for availability reasons and remediation. Expand each
group's `names` into entries, inheriting the inventory-level client requirements
unless the group overrides them. The grouped name union is the complete tool
inventory; use `tools/list` for canonical tool schemas. The default summary keeps
each provider candidate's availability and target-support status, code and
reason; `omitted_fields` lists what it leaves out. Request `{"detail": "complete"}`
only when you need an unavailable candidate's remediation, provider
diagnostics, candidate capability sets, or tool surface, effect and annotation
flags; in those closed flag vocabularies, listed
flags are true and omitted known flags are false. Provider candidate facts
describe possible providers, while top-level session capabilities describe the
current route and `analysis_provider_binding` names the selected provider. Do
not treat those scopes as interchangeable.

## Work summary-first

Start with the default result and use its inline Evidence and graph context.
For a JavaScript application or ELF layout whose size is unknown or large,
call `analyze_javascript_application` or `inspect_binary_layout` with
`"detail": "summary"`, then inspect the retained `parent_evidence_id` with
`inspect_analysis_view`. Over MCP, `analyze_function` is summary-first without
a flag: its default reply is the summary, and the complete dossier stays
retained under `parent_evidence_id` for facet paging. Pass that ID as a
`retained-evidence` reference to `compare_functions`, or inside
`match_native_functions` `left_observations`/`right_observations` or
`build_call_path.functions`; request `"detail": "complete"` only when the
dossier must travel inline.
Use the same exact-reference form in other advertised logical Evidence inputs,
including optional sources, arrays and nested sources across domains. Each
source can independently be inline or retained; preserve its source identity,
coverage, partial facts and unknowns. A summary or inspection page has its own
Evidence ID: use `normalized_result.parent_evidence_id` when the consumer needs
the complete source. For portable CLI follow-ups, commands advertising
`--evidence-bundle` resolve references from that selected exported bundle.
See [Evidence composition](references/evidence-workflows.md) for scope and
recovery; file selectors are supported only where explicitly advertised.
Page module identities and select the returned `node_id` before requesting an
item; a single file path can represent several graph roles. Do not repeat an
identical analysis or rejected call without a changed input or resolved blocker.
Recheck session state when a lifecycle change makes that status useful.
Make a focused follow-up only when the
returned result leaves a specific question unanswered.

For oversized MCP results and a retained parent ID that is unknown, read [evidence paging](references/evidence-paging.md).

A client can also truncate a successful tool result without a REA transport
error. Treat that preview as incomplete; use the retained parent ID for smaller
views or export when the full record is needed. Do not parse the preview as
canonical JSON or repeat the producer. For JavaScript, read the
[module-view and trace recipes](references/javascript-applications.md) before
drilling into a large graph; a broad bidirectional trace can expand unrelated
containment relationships even after summary analysis.

Every conclusion must distinguish observations, inferences, and unknowns. Cite
Evidence IDs, preserve limitations and incomplete coverage, and never imply
that static analysis observed execution. Runtime requests execute the declared
target and lifecycle; do not broaden the target or action beyond those fields.

Within the user's requested investigation, call available analysis tools
directly. REA does not require permission grants or per-call approval flags.
The agent client can independently require approval. Follow the declared request
scope and the host's actual access requirements; use the recovery guide for an
observed client-policy rejection.

## Plan broader investigations

For requests that span multiple features or subsystems, use a staged workflow:

1. Turn the request into a checklist of questions and the evidence each answer
   needs. Resolve target identity and constraints from the conversation and
   workspace before asking for information again.
2. Inspect the current REA session, artifact identity, saved analysis database,
   bookmarks, and prior evidence. Reuse matching state; do not open duplicate
   sessions or repeat identical analysis.
3. Start with the smallest useful overview or inventory. Follow each question
   from its entry point through relevant data and state changes to its result.
   Batch related operations around a specific hypothesis, then expand only when
   the returned evidence leaves a concrete gap.
4. Inspect relevant packaged resources and configuration alongside code when
   they affect the question. Use format-aware inventory and parsers; do not
   infer behavior from filenames, strings, or layout alone.
5. Corroborate a conclusion with the evidence type it requires. Use runtime
   observation only when static evidence cannot answer the question and the
   required host runtime and OS access are available. For JavaScript behavior,
   run probes against the actual app through the available browser, Electron,
   or process capture workflow.
6. Decompose work into independent questions. When parallel workers are
   available and the questions do not depend on one another, assign distinct
   scopes, point workers to existing evidence, and ask them to return sources,
   conclusions, and unresolved gaps. Otherwise, work sequentially.
7. Keep a concise finding ledger linking each conclusion to Evidence IDs,
   confidence/evidence type, search boundary, and remaining unknowns. Update
   the shared index or investigation report so later passes can reuse results.

Before finishing, revisit the original checklist. Mark each question as
answered, partially answered, or unresolved based on its evidence; keep
bounded negative searches bounded, and do not describe a broad investigation
as complete while required questions remain open.

## Finish the task

Explain findings in plain language and tie them to returned evidence. When the
user asks to build something, use normal coding tools and separate observed
behavior from design choices. Close an opened native session with
`close_binary` when its engine is no longer needed. Evidence references and Unknown
history remain in memory on the same MCP connection. End the investigation with
`reset_investigation`; supply `save_path` to checkpoint the complete bundle before
clearing. Import the saved bundle to restore original references and Unknown
history in a new process. Retention is bounded and is not automatic persistence.
