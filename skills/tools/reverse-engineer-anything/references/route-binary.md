# Binary routes

Read this when the target is a native executable, library or analysis database, a managed assembly, a Go or Rust binary, a PE, ELF or Mach-O file to inspect, or a native provider such as IDA, Kuna or Ghidra.

- Managed PE/CLI assembly: `inspect_managed_artifact`.

- .NET NativeAOT PE/ELF: native Ghidra analysis. Native code can yield pseudocode;
  consult the NativeAOT workflow in `native-and-artifacts.md` for
  optional metadata recovery and its supported host/layout boundary.
- Native program behavior, live calls, instrumentation, or command-run effects:
  choose the matching [native runtime workflow](runtime-observation.md#native-runtime-questions).
  `open_binary` and `trace_native_values` establish static facts; they do not
  observe execution. Runtime tools have distinct launch, attach, mutation and
  cleanup effects, and do not require a preliminary static session unless their
  own contract says so.

- Embedded Go compiler, module or build-setting metadata: `inspect_go_binary`
  with the explicit local file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no
  Go installation or disassembler. Preserve raw module bytes and source ranges;
  absent metadata does not prove a binary is not Go, and unparsed text records
  remain explicit. See the
  [Go binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/go-binaries.md).
- Embedded CUDA/HIP code objects: `inspect_gpu_code_objects`; inventory targets
  first, then decode selected payloads and query retained GPU Evidence.

- Embedded cargo-auditable Rust dependency metadata: `inspect_rust_binary`
  with the explicit local ELF, PE, or thin Mach-O file. This built-in
  target-free inspection requires no Rust installation or disassembler. Preserve
  package order, dependency indices, and the section file range. A missing
  `.dep-v0` section is null metadata, not proof the binary has no dependencies.
  A rustc commit hash is an inference from a read-only `/rustc/<40-hex>/` path.
  For selected crates, use `view: {collection: "packages", names: [...],
  fields: ["name", "version", "source"]}` on the first call; explicitly include
  `dependencies` for direct index references. Use `detail: "summary"` for counts
  and ranges, or retained `inspect_analysis_view` Rust package/edge pages for
  subsequent filters. Keep the complete parent Evidence accessible; CLI compact
  delivery requires `--evidence_output`.
  See the
  [Rust binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/rust-binaries.md).
- PE Authenticode certificate table: `inspect_pe_certificates` with the explicit
  local PE32/PE32+ file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no
  Windows SDK. Preserve WIN_CERTIFICATE ranges, types, payload SHA-256, and
  PKCS#7 signer/X.509 identity fields, including `subject_key_identifier_hex`
  when the signer uses that form. A missing security directory is observed
  absence of that table, not proof the image is unsigned in every catalog sense.
  Signatures are not verified. See the
  [PE certificate guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/pe-certificates.md).
- PE import and delay-load tables: `inspect_pe_imports` with the explicit
  local PE32/PE32+ file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no
  Windows SDK. Preserve DLL names, named and ordinal functions, ILT/IAT RVAs,
  delay-load descriptors, and the pefile import hash of the standard import
  table. A missing import directory is observed absence of that table, not
  proof the image never imported APIs through another table. Bound snapshots
  and loaded IAT contents remain unobserved. See the
  [PE import guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/pe-imports.md).
- PE TLS callbacks and load configuration: `inspect_pe_load_config` with the
  explicit local PE32/PE32+ file. This built-in target-free inspection requires
  no Windows SDK. Preserve callback VAs as strings with their RVA, file offset
  and section, and the size-covered security cookie, SafeSEH, CFG,
  EH-continuation and XFG fields. Guard-flag mitigation claims are inferred
  linker declarations, not proof of enforcement. A missing directory is observed
  absence of that declaration. See the
  [PE load configuration guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/pe-load-config.md).
- ELF, PE, and Mach-O hardening: `inspect_binary_hardening` with the explicit
  local file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no pwntools or other
  host tool. One image per Mach-O slice. Each property is `enabled`, `disabled`,
  `partial`, `unknown`, or `not_applicable`, with the header field or import
  behind it. A missing stack-protector or fortify import is `unknown`, not
  proof the protection was omitted. Authenticode and Mach-O code signatures
  report presence, not validity. Hardened runtime stays unknown and names
  `inspect_signature`. The image is not executed. See the
  [binary hardening guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/binary-hardening.md).
- ELF note tables: `inspect_elf_notes` with the explicit local ELF32/ELF64
  file. This built-in target-free inspection requires no disassembler. Preserve
  PT_NOTE and SHT_NOTE ranges, owners, types, descriptor SHA-256, and GNU
  build-id or ABI-tag fields. A missing table is observed absence of those
  declarations, not proof the image never carried notes. See the
  [ELF notes guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/elf-notes.md).

- Explicit Linux ELF file for offline layout, symbols, relocations or static
  mitigation evidence: `inspect_binary_layout`. This target-free operation uses
  caller-supplied pwntools without opening a disassembler database. Preserve its
  raw locations and inference/coverage limits; see the
  [offline binary guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/binary-diagnostics.md).

- PE resource type/name/language trees and static icon group references:
  `inspect_pe_resources` with an explicit path. This portable operation requires
  no active target or engine; opaque payloads retain file ranges and SHA-256.
- PE export directories and ELF dynamic-symbol exports: `inspect_native_exports`
  with an explicit path; portable, no active target or engine.
- Native executable, library, or analysis database: `open_binary`, then
  use focused analysis tools directly; call `binary_overview` when metadata or
  inventory context is useful and available from the selected provider.

For an existing IDA MCP configuration, use `open_binary` with the original
input binary and `provider_id: "ida"`; do not pass an `.idb` or `.i64` database.
The legacy attached profile binds the already-open GUI input by SHA-256 and
leaves its database open. The modern headless profile creates and closes an
owned private database without saving. Installation and registration reuse
[mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp](https://github.com/mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp); see the
[IDA provider guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/ida-provider.md).
For migration to the separate native IDA MCP plugin, follow the guide's
[legacy attached migration](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/ida-provider.md#migrate-a-legacy-attached-registration).
Replace the upstream registration explicitly; modern mrexodia tools are not the
native profile. Native attachment preserves the database but does not provide
direct callers; check session availability and the guide's verification limits.
Proceed directly to `analyze_function`, pseudocode, or function/string searches
after opening; IDA does not supply `binary_overview`. Consult session availability
when composing broader workflows. Modern direct callers and unsupported dossier
facets remain unknown; live IDA results are not replayed from snapshots.

With `REA_KUNA_COMMAND` configured, `provider_id: "kuna"` answers procedure
lists, lookups, pseudocode, assembly and `analyze_function` from Kuna's cached
whole-program export. Callers/callees use a separate body-free graph shared by
the session; `xrefs` returns exact-address incoming sites and filters forwarding
aliases. These queries and inventory lookups do not trigger a C export. Indirect
targets remain unknown and can make relationship coverage partial. Reference
caches expire on close; a fresh CLI process repeats the native reference walk.
Typed references, CFG, raw-memory tools and annotations remain unsupported. A cold first
answer can come from a single-function run (its limitations say so); assembly
waits for the export. For pseudocode and assembly, `raw_result.source` names the
cached `.c`/`.asm` file and byte span, which you may search directly instead of
calling per function. See the
[Kuna provider guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/kuna-provider.md).

For a Ghidra startup timeout on a large native target, follow
[deadline recovery](native-and-artifacts.md#ghidra-startup-deadline-recovery)
before abandoning deep analysis or repeating the same cold import. The default
330 seconds can be changed for new startup attempts through
`update_analysis_settings` using `ghidra.startup_timeout_ms`. Changing the
server's launch environment instead requires a new REA process.
