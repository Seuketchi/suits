# Mobile app and package routes

Read this when the target is an Android APK, an Apple app bundle or its resources, or an archive or package inventory. The entry's routing list links here.

- Archive/package member inventory (ZIP/APK/IPA/MSIX/AppX, DMG, or a PyInstaller
  executable): `open_binary` with the supplied local path; use `inspect_artifact`
  when its graph and findings help answer the question. A PyInstaller CArchive
  is the application layer; the bootloader is only the native prefix. Start with
  `detail: "summary"` for large inventories, then use retained inventory views
  for selected member fields/pages. A complete small inventory can cost less
  than extra calls and schemas. Runtime options are metadata, not files.
  Compact delivery still inventories and hashes members. See the
  [Python packaged applications guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/python-packaged-applications.md).

- Apple app plist, Interface Builder, asset catalog, or keyed archive resources:
  `open_bundle_resources`, then the selected resource tool. This does not
  require `CFBundleExecutable` or a deep provider. Resource sessions have no
  executable digest or binary snapshot; use `open_binary` for native code.

- Android APK code, classes, methods, or incoming references:
  `inspect_android_package`, then focused Android tools when advertised.
  Archive member inventory still uses the archive route above.

- Explicit local Android APK (or ZIP/AAB) signing: `inspect_apk_signature`.
  Prefer its summary or selected signer/digest/lineage page; retain complete
  Evidence and use `inspect_analysis_view` kind `apk-signature` for follow-ups.
  Reports which schemes are present (v1 JAR, v2, v3, v3.1), each signer's
  certificate SHA-256 fingerprint (v1 included, from its PKCS#7 block), v3 key-rotation lineage, source stamp, and
  whether each signed digest still matches the bytes (self-consistency). This
  is identity and integrity, not a trust or authenticity verdict.
  See the [APK signature guide](https://github.com/morluto/rea/blob/main/docs/apk-signature.md).
