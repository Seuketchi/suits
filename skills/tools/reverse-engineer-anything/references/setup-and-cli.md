# Setup, registration repair and the CLI fallback

Read this when REA tools are missing, a call is blocked by the client, a required provider is unavailable, or a setup-owned registration needs repair.

If tools are absent, a call is blocked by the client, or a required provider is
unavailable, read [connection and recovery](connection-and-recovery.md).
Diagnose the observed blocker, continue useful supported work, and resume the
original task after repair. Client approval, shell PATH, registration and engine
availability have different remedies; avoid repeating setup for all of them.
If the host times out without a REA result, do not repeat the unchanged call or
assume work stopped. Read the recovery guide's deadline distinction before retrying.
If the MCP connection drops, retry that call once only when it is safe to
repeat or known not to have started. If it may already have changed the
target, or it fails again, tell the user and ask them to restart the MCP
client. If REA could not start its connection, retry once, then tell the user
and ask them to restart the MCP client. Do not retry a startup failure that
returns the same unchanged result. For plugin installs, follow
[plugin recovery](connection-and-recovery.md#rea-installed-as-a-client-plugin).
For setup-owned registrations, run `rea doctor` when REA could not start
or tools stay missing after that restart. For `cleanup_incomplete`, a retryable
capacity limit, or `configuration_invalid`, follow the recovery guide's ladder
before asking for a restart. Read that guide before a second repair attempt.

Choose the installation owner before repairing registration. Plugin installs use
[plugin recovery](connection-and-recovery.md#rea-installed-as-a-client-plugin);
only setup-owned registrations use the guide's
[registration repair plan](connection-and-recovery.md#repair-registration-when-needed).
A plugin-only doctor result of `missing` does not call for `rea setup`.

REA setup never installs or upgrades Node.js, npm, Homebrew, Java, Ghidra, IDA,
JADX, Kuna, Binwalk, or Unblob. Use existing prerequisites; do not install unrelated
software to repair MCP registration. For an unsupported client, use manual stdio
registration with an existing installation’s absolute runtime and entry script, or continue through the CLI.

A concrete CLI fallback for an operator-supplied JavaScript tree or ASAR is:

```bash
npx -y rea-agents@latest analyze-javascript-application /absolute/path/to/app --json
```

No MCP registration or native engine is required. Read the returned Evidence,
graph, limitations, and unknowns with the same care as an MCP result; the CLI
returns the Evidence record directly. This fallback does not establish that
MCP is configured. Native CLI tasks still require their selected engine.
Prefer an existing `rea` CLI. When none is installed and REA package acquisition
is within the authorized scope, use `npx -y rea-agents@latest` in its place from a
trusted directory outside the target project, with absolute target paths. Managed
setup binds the current installation directly; retain its runtime and package
cache entry, or restore that installation before repairing its registration.
For setup-owned registration, configuration repair starts with a read-only setup plan; show paths, backups and
skill replacement before applying authorized changes. Preserve existing approval
and target-execution boundaries.
